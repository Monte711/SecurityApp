# EDR/AV Integration

Endpoint Detection and Response integration with ClamAV and YARA.

## Overview

This module provides malware detection capabilities by integrating with ClamAV antivirus engine and YARA rule engine. It analyzes files from endpoint agents and provides threat assessment.

## Features

- **ClamAV Integration**: Real-time malware scanning
- **YARA Rules**: Custom rule-based detection
- **Hash Analysis**: SHA256 hash reputation checking
- **Quarantine Management**: Secure file isolation
- **Threat Classification**: Severity assessment and categorization
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient scanning for high-volume environments

## Components

### ClamAV Scanner
- Signature-based malware detection
- Automatic signature updates
- Support for custom signatures

### YARA Engine  
- Custom rule development and deployment
- Pattern matching for advanced threats
- Memory and file scanning capabilities

### Hash Reputation
- Local hash database
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- Allowlist/blocklist management

## API Endpoints

### POST /scan/file
Submit file for malware analysis.

### POST /scan/hash  
Check hash reputation.

### GET /rules
List active YARA rules.

### POST /quarantine
Quarantine suspicious files.

## Configuration

```yaml
clamav:
  host: "clamav"
  port: 3310
  timeout: 30

yara:
  rules_dir: "/opt/yara/rules"
  update_interval: 3600

hash_db:
  storage: "redis"
  ttl: 86400

quarantine:
  enabled: true
  path: "/opt/quarantine"
  encryption: true
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally  
python -m app.main

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Docker deployment
docker-compose up --build
```

## YARA Rules

Custom rules in `rules/` directory:
- `malware.yar`: General malware patterns
- `apt.yar`: Advanced persistent threat indicators  
- `crypto.yar`: Cryptocurrency mining detection
- `ransomware.yar`: Ransomware behavior patterns

## TODO
- [ ] Machine learning integration for zero-day detection
- [ ] Behavioral analysis engine
- [ ] Advanced sandboxing capabilities
- [ ] Integration with external threat feeds
- [ ] Real-time file monitoring
