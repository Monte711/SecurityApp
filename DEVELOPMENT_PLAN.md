# Project Development Plan

## Module Implementation Priority

Based on the requirements, here are the first three modules to implement:

### 1. **ingest-api** (Priority 1)
- **Rationale**: Core dependency for all other modules
- **Components**: FastAPI service, OpenSearch integration, Redis streaming
- **Key Features**: JSON validation, idempotency, event storage
- **Delivery**: Standalone service with comprehensive tests

### 2. **agent-windows** (Priority 2)  
- **Rationale**: Primary data source for the platform
- **Components**: Windows telemetry collection, secure transmission
- **Key Features**: Process/file/network monitoring, configurable collection levels
- **Delivery**: Python agent with local testing capabilities

### 3. **edr-av-integration** (Priority 3)
- **Rationale**: Essential security analysis capability
- **Components**: ClamAV integration, YARA rules, hash analysis
- **Key Features**: Malware detection, threat classification
- **Delivery**: Analysis service with scanning APIs

## Implementation Approach

Each module will be developed as a completely autonomous component with:

✅ **Complete autonomy** - No dependencies on other modules during development
✅ **Mocked integrations** - Mock external services for testing  
✅ **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, acceptance criteria
✅ **Docker containerization** - Local deployment with docker-compose
✅ **Production-ready code** - Error handling, logging, graceful shutdown
✅ **Clear documentation** - API specs, usage examples, configuration guides

## Next Steps

Ready to generate detailed implementation prompts for each module in priority order. Each prompt will include:

- Complete technical specification
- API contracts and data schemas  
- Test requirements and acceptance criteria
- Docker configuration and local setup
- Environment variables and configuration
- Integration points and mock implementations

The platform foundation is established. Confirm to proceed with detailed module implementation prompts.
