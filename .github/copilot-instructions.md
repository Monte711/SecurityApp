# Unified Enterprise Cybersecurity Platform

This workspace contains a modular cybersecurity platform with the following components:

## Project Structure
- `ingest-api/` - Telemetry ingestion service (FastAPI)
- `agent-windows/` - Windows endpoint agent
- `edr-av-integration/` - ClamAV + YARA integration
- `vuln-scanner/` - OpenVAS vulnerability scanning
- `tip-misp/` - Threat Intelligence Platform
- `soar-engine/` - Security Orchestration and Response
- `ui-dashboard/` - React-based web interface
- `ml-module/` - Machine learning behavioral analytics
- `shared/` - Common utilities and schemas
- `docker/` - Docker configurations
- `tests/` - Integration tests

## Development Guidelines
- Each module is autonomous with its own tests and README
- Use Python 3.11 with type hints, black formatting, flake8 linting
- All services containerized with Docker
- OpenSearch for data storage, Redis for queues
- TLS encryption for agent communications
- Configurable data collection levels (minimal/standard/detailed)

## Getting Started
1. Each module has its own docker-compose.yml for local development
2. Run tests with `pytest` in each module directory
3. Use `.env.example` files for configuration templates
