# SecurityApp Scripts Fix Summary

## Problem
The PowerShell scripts were not working correctly because they contained hardcoded paths from the previous development environment:
- `c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA`
- `c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\agent\windows`

These paths were specific to the original developer's system and would not work on other machines.

## Solution
All scripts have been updated to use dynamic path resolution based on the current script location using PowerShell's `$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path` and `Split-Path` commands.

## Fixed Scripts

### 1. start.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA"
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
Set-Location "$scriptPath\INFRA"
```

### 2. stop.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA"
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
Set-Location "$scriptPath\INFRA"
```

### 3. manage-agent.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
$agentPath = "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\agent\windows"
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
$agentPath = "$scriptPath\agent\windows"
```

### 4. quick-start.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA"
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
Set-Location "$scriptPath\INFRA"
```

### 5. start-all.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA"
Write-Host "  cd c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\agent\windows" -ForegroundColor Gray
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
Set-Location "$scriptPath\INFRA"
Write-Host "  .\start-agent.ps1" -ForegroundColor Gray
```

### 6. stop-all.ps1
**Before:**
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\Users\PC\Desktop\test\INFRA"
```

**After:**
```powershell
$scriptPath = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path
Set-Location "$scriptPath\INFRA"
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Portability**: Scripts now work from any location where the SecurityApp folder is placed
2. **No Manual Configuration**: No need to update paths when moving the project
3. **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: Works on any Windows machine with PowerShell
4. **Relative Path Resolution**: All paths are calculated relative to the script location

## Testing Verification

All path resolutions have been tested and confirmed to work correctly:
- ✅ INFRA directory path resolution
- ✅ agent\windows directory path resolution  
- ✅ docker-compose.yml file location
- ✅ All PowerShell script references

## Usage

Now you can run any of the scripts from the SecurityApp directory without worrying about hardcoded paths:

```powershell
# Start the platform
.\start.ps1

# Check status
.\status.ps1

# Start agent
.\start-agent.ps1

# Stop everything
.\stop.ps1
```

The scripts will automatically detect their location and navigate to the correct subdirectories as needed.
